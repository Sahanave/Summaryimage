Project Objective:
In this project,I implement a video summarization algorithm that produces a
“summary image” summarizing the video content.I used the technique of 
Key frame extraction and usedkey frames to create a summary image.

Starter Code for reading and displaying a single RGB image was given,I extended this idea to read RGB image of a
video file.
Starter Code for display Window was also shared.
